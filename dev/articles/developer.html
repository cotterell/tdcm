and experienced contributors. Contributions to TDCM are always welcome;
however, to keep things consistent and easier to maintain, the package
maintainer asks that all contributors follow the policies and guidelines
included in this document when preparing and submitting their
contributions to the package.</p>

<p><strong>Would you like to help contribute to TDCM?</strong> We are
more than happy to work with our community to improve our user
experience! Some ways that you or your team can contribute are listed
below. You can click on each contribution type to learn more.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="#issue-reporting">Issue Reporting</a>: Report any bugs
or issues you come across so that we can try to fix them</p></li>

</h3>
<p>If you notice any errors, bugs, or unexpected behaviors in the TDCM
package, please use the Issues feature on GitHub. This will allow us to
respond promptly and keep all required fixes in one place. To do so, log
in to your GitHub account (or create one if you do not already have
one), then follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Navigate to our <a href="https://github.com/cotterell/tdcm/issues" class="external-link">issues page</a> on
GitHub.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Use the search area to see if the same issue you encountered or
something similar has already been reported.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If an existing issue report applies to your specific issue, then
open that report and read the comment history. If you are unable to find
a solution in the comments, then leave a new comment to let us know that
you have encountered the same issue or something similar along with
enough details for a developer to reproduce your version of the issue.
One of the first things the development team will do is attempt to
reproduce the issue, so these additional details are very important and
including them often leads to quicker fixes.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If the issue has not been reported yet, submit a new issue
report:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click the green “New Issue” button.</li>
<li>Click “Get Started” next to “Bug Report”</li>
<li>Click “Submit New Issue” once you have finished filling out the
form.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Whether you commented on an existing issue report or submitted a
new one, you can track the progress of the issue report by visiting its
page on GitHub. If the developers need reach out to you for more
information, they will do so by mentioning your name in a new comment
that they add to the report. When this happens, GitHub should notify you
about it. Replying to the developer should help the developers resolve
the issue more quickly!</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="feature-request">Feature Request<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#feature-request"></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Have any features you would like us to add?</strong> Please
let us know using the Issues feature on GitHub!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Issues</em> is a feature on GitHub that streamlines communication
between users and developers and consolidates all project tasks in one
place. While this of course includes bugs, it is often used for managing
feature requests and improvements, allowing it to serve as a “To-Do
List” developers can use to know what they should be focusing on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To create an Issue report, log in to your GitHub account (or create
one if you do not already have one) and follow the instructions
below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Navigate to our <a href="https://github.com/cotterell/tdcm/issues" class="external-link">issues page</a> on
GitHub.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Use the search box to see if the feature you’re thinking of has
already been requested.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If there is already a request, please interact with it!</p></li>
<li><p>You can use the emoji icon to add a reaction, such as a “thumbs
up” to show your support! This will let us know which features to
prioritize by showing how many people want a particular
feature. </p></li>
<li><p>Additionally, feel free to voice your opinions in the replies of
the request page! You can add additional details you’d like to see
implemented, or simply express your desire for the feature to be
added!</p></li>
<li>
<p>If there is no existing request for the feature, you can make
your own:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click the green “New Issue” button</li>
<li>Click “Get Started” next to “Feature Request”</li>
<li>Click “Submit New Issue” once you’ve finished filling out the
form!</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Once you have posted your feature request, developers may reply

<p>The below section describes what Git is and how to use it to help
contribute to this repository.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-is-git">What is Git?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-git"></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F" class="external-link">Git</a>
is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in
their code over time. It’s like a time machine for your project files,
enabling you to save different versions (called “commits”) of your code.
Each commit records what changes were made, by whom, and when, making it
easy to revert back to older versions if something goes wrong with the
current code.</p>
<p>This is a breakdown of key features and concepts in Git:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository" class="external-link">Repository</a>
(or <em>repo</em>): This is where all your project’s files and their
history are stored. It can be located on your computer (local
repository) or on a remote server (remote repository).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository" class="external-link">Commit</a>:
A commit is like a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
When you make changes to your files, you ‘commit’ these changes, which
saves a record of what was altered, allowing you to track the evolution
of your project.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository" class="external-link">Branch</a>:
Branches allow you to create separate versions of your project within
the same repository. You might use a branch to develop a new feature
while keeping the main project (usually called the “master” or “main”
branch) stable.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository" class="external-link">Merge</a>:
When you’ve finished working in a branch, you can merge your changes
back into the main branch. This combines the histories of both branches,
integrating the new features or changes into the main project.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Maintaining-a-Project" class="external-link">Pull</a>:
Pulling refers to downloading changes from a remote repository to your
local one. This is useful when working in teams, as it lets you see and
integrate the changes made by others.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push" class="external-link">Push</a>: Pushing
refers to uploading your local repository changes to a remote
repository. This is how you share your work with others or back up your
current state to a remote location.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using <a href="https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git" class="external-link">Git</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control" class="external-link">multiple</a>
developers can work on the same project simultaneously without
interfering with each others’ work, as they can work in different
branches and merge changes only when ready. This collaborative feature,
along with the ability to track every change, makes Git an essential
tool for modern software development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="git-vs--github">Git vs. GitHub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#git-vs--github"></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/" class="external-link">Git</a> is a version control system
(VCS) that helps you track changes in your code files. It allows
multiple developers to work together on the same project effectively and
efficiently by providing tools to manage differing versions of code. Git
is used to create branches, handle merges, revert to previous states,
and more, directly from your local machine or a server without needing
an internet connection. Git operates primarily on your local system,
managing your local repository. However, it can synchronize with remote
repositories.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">GitHub</a> is a hosting service for Git
repositories. It is a platform where you can upload your Git
repositories and collaborate with others. Beyond the basic functionality
of Git, GitHub provides additional features such as bug tracking,
feature requests, task management, and wikis for project documentation.
GitHub is designed to facilitate easier collaboration among team members
on a project. It offers graphical tools for managing pull requests, code
reviews, and even project management tools like issues and project
boards.</p>
<p>In essence, Git is the tool that enables version control, while
GitHub is a service that hosts your repositories and adds extra features
to enhance collaboration among team members. Both work hand-in-hand to
support the development process, but they serve different roles within
that framework.</p>

</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews" class="external-link">pull
request</a> (PR), also known as a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging" class="external-link">merge
request</a> in some systems like GitLab, is a feature used in Git
repositories that lets developers notify team members about changes
they’ve pushed to a branch in a repository on platforms like GitHub,
Bitbucket, or GitLab. Essentially, it’s a request to review and then
merge this branch into another branch, typically the main project
branch.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works in simple terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request" class="external-link">Branch
Creation</a>: First, a developer creates a branch from the main code
base to work on a new feature, a bug fix, or any updates. This
separation ensures that the main code base remains unaffected until the
new changes are reviewed and approved.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository" class="external-link">Making
Changes and Committing</a>: The developer makes necessary changes in
this new branch, commits these changes, and pushes the branch to a
remote repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Opening a Pull Request: Once the branch is updated on the remote
repository, the developer opens a pull request. This PR is essentially a
request to the rest of the team to review the changes made in the branch
before it gets merged into the main branch.</p></li>
<li><p>Review and Discussion: Team members review the changes, discuss
potential improvements, and may request further <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-comparing-branches-in-pull-requests" class="external-link">changes</a>
if needed. This process is crucial for maintaining code quality and
ensuring that the integration aligns with the project’s overall
direction.</p></li>
<li><p>Approval and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github" class="external-link">Merge</a>:
After the changes are reviewed and approved by the necessary team
members or according to the project’s guidelines, the pull request can
be merged. This means that the changes in the branch will be integrated
into the target branch, usually the main or master branch.</p></li>
<li><p>Closure and Cleanup: Once merged, the pull request is closed, and
it’s common to delete the branch to keep the repository clean and
manageable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Pull Requests are a vital part of the collaborative development
process, enabling transparency, improving code quality, and helping
manage contributions to a project efficiently. They facilitate a peer
review system which is beneficial for both team cohesion and project
integrity.</p>

<p>RStudio does not have a built-in method of creating a pull request.
However, it has a built-in terminal that can be used to push changes to
a forked repository with a GitHub remote origin. GitHub must then be
used to create a pull request.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>On GitHub: Click the “Fork” button on the project to make changes
to.</p></li>
<li><p>On RStudio: Create a new project and use Version Control with

project.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Add the original repository as an upstream version. This should
be done in RStudio’s built-in terminal. Type in:</p>
<pre><code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/cotterell/tdcm.git</code></pre>
