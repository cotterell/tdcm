Description: The **tdcm** package implements estimation of the transition DCM
    (TDCM; Madison & Bradshaw, 2018), a longitudinal extension of the
    log-linear cognitive diagnosis model (LCDM; Henson, Templin, & Willse,
    2009). As the LCDM subsumes many other DCMs, many other DCMs can be
    estimated longitudinally via the TDCM. The package includes functions
    to estimate the single-group and multigroup TDCM, summarize results of
    interest including item parameters, growth proportions, transition
    probabilities, transitional reliability, attribute correlations, model fit,
    and growth plots.
