Description: Estimate the transition diagnostic classification model (TDCM) 
    described in Madison & Bradshaw (2018) <doi:10.1007/s11336-018-9638-5>, a 
    longitudinal extension of the log-linear cognitive diagnosis model (LCDM) in 
    Henson, Templin & Willse (2009) <doi:10.1007/s11336-008-9089-5>. As the LCDM 
    subsumes many other diagnostic classification models (DCMs), many other DCMs 
    can be estimated longitudinally via the TDCM. The 'TDCM' package includes 
    functions to estimate the single-group and multigroup TDCM, summarize 
    results of interest including item parameters, growth proportions, 
    transition probabilities, transitional reliability, attribute correlations, 
    model fit, and growth plots.
